docker build -t oscar-frontend .

# Run locally
docker run -p 80:80 oscar-frontend

# Deploy to cloud (AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, etc.)
```

## üîß Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Flutter App
Create `lib/config/environment.dart`:
```dart
class Environment {
  static const String apiBaseUrl = String.fromEnvironment(
    'API_BASE_URL',
    defaultValue: 'https://api.oscar-platform.com',
  );
  
  static const String environment = String.fromEnvironment(
    'ENVIRONMENT',
    defaultValue: 'development',
  );
}
```

#### React App
Create `.env.production`:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.oscar-platform.com
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

#### GitHub Actions for Flutter
```yaml
name: Flutter CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      with:
        flutter-version: '3.9.2'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: flutter pub get
      working-directory: flutter_app
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: flutter test
      working-directory: flutter_app
    
    - name: Build APK
      run: flutter build apk --release
      working-directory: flutter_app
```

#### GitHub Actions for React
```yaml
name: React CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
        cache-dependency-path: oscar-frontend/package-lock.json
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      working-directory: oscar-frontend
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      working-directory: oscar-frontend
    
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
      working-directory: oscar-frontend
    
    - name: Deploy to Netlify
      uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v2.0
      with:
        publish-dir: './oscar-frontend/build'
        production-branch: main
      env:
        NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
        NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
```

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Performance Monitoring
- **Flutter**: Firebase Performance Monitoring
- **React**: Web Vitals, Lighthouse CI
- **Backend**: Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

### Error Tracking
- **Flutter**: Firebase Crashlytics
- **React**: Sentry, Bugsnag
- **Logs**: Centralized logging with ELK stack

### Analytics
- **Google Analytics**: User behavior tracking
- **Firebase Analytics**: Mobile app analytics
- **Custom Events**: Career assessment completions, resume uploads

## üîí Security Considerations

### HTTPS/SSL
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Configure SSL certificates properly
- Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

### API Security
- Implement proper authentication (JWT tokens)
- Use API rate limiting
- Validate all inputs server-side
- Implement CORS properly

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure communication protocols
- Implement proper session management
- Regular security audits

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Flutter Issues
```bash
# Clear build cache
flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Fix iOS build issues
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Android signing issues
flutter build apk --debug --verbose
```

### Common React Issues
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Fix dependency issues
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Build issues
npm run build -- --verbose
```

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### CDN Setup
- Use CloudFront, CloudFlare, or similar
- Configure proper caching headers
- Optimize images and assets

### Database Scaling
- Implement database indexing
- Use connection pooling
- Consider read replicas for scaling

### Load Balancing
- Use Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Implement health checks
- Auto-scaling groups for high availability
